# Skin_Cancer_Detection_Project

INTRODUCTION

Skin cancer is one of the most world-wide diseases that
cause death. It is the abnormal growth of skin cells, most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. But this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight.

There are three major types of skin cancer

Basal cell carcinoma

Squamous cell carcinoma

Melanoma

Note: two types of carcinoma are very near to each other so usually initial categorization comes in melanoma and non-melanoma.

Early detection of these lesions may increase the curing rate to 90%. The high similarity
between different types of skin lesions makes the visual examination hard and may lead to wrong investigation. Therefore, an automated system is required for skin lesion classification.

Skin cancer is the cancer you can see. Unlike cancers that develop inside the body, skin cancers form on the outside and are usually visible. That’s why skin exams, both at home and with a dermatologist, are especially vital. Early detection saves lives. This project gives the power to detect cancer early when it’s easiest to cure, before it can become dangerous, disfiguring or deadly.

METHODOLOGY

We will use Deep Learning and Transfer Learning to train the model that can classify skin Cancer Melanoma and Non-Melanoma. We can compare the accuracy results of three transfer learning techniques. They are:

MobileNet V2

InceptionV3

VGG16

Then, we use the MobileNetV2 Model for fine tuning to obtain more improved results with high accuracy and then use the model for skin cancer detection mobile app development.

Objectives:

Detection and Analysis of Skin Cancer

Binary classification of Melanoma and Non-Melanoma skin cancers
